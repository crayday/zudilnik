* workedproject (wp): alternative command like "worked" but for projects/subprojects instead of goals
* command for counting total duration of some subproject in an interval
  like "2020-02-19" for single day
  or "2020-02-12 2020-02-19" for week
  or "2020-02" for month
  E.g.:
  select sum(duration)/3600.0 from timelog where subproject_id in (select id from subprojects where project_id = (select id from projects where name = "litres")) and started_at between strftime('%s',"2020-08-18 07:15:00+03:00") and strftime('%s',"2020-08-19 07:15:00+03:00");
  ***
  select sum(duration)/3600.0 from timelog where subproject_id = (select id from subprojects where name = "d20prog") and started_at between strftime('%s',"2021-06-23 00:00:00+03:00") and strftime('%s',"2021-06-24 00:00:00+03:00");
* command that will print every project that was working on during a given period of time
  and time spent on it
* in the 'goalinfo' command output data about how much worked this week
  (from monday), this month (from 1st day of month)
* in the 'goalinfo' command output data about 7 days (worked x/y hours)
* support short dates in "hoursperday" command
* get rid of subprojects, leave only projects.
  - create projects.parent field
  - add field timelog.project_id with corresponding key
  - make a script that will go for each subproject and:
    * create corresponding projects record (with same projects.parent value as in subprojects.parent)
    * fill timelog.project_id field with new ID for all timelog.subproject_id = <OLD_ID>
  - remove field.timelog.subproject_id field
  - remove goals.subproject_id field
  - fix code
* ability to archive old subprojects.
  - add field archived_at
  - select old subprojects list this:
    | select distinct sp.id, sp.name
    | from subprojects sp
    |   left join timelog t on t.subproject_id = sp.id
    |     and t.started_at > strftime('%s', 'now') - 3600*24*30*2 -- 2 month
    | where sp.project_id = 1
    |   and t.id is null
    | group by sp.id;
* countable goals
* add 'apply when' functionality to 'hoursperday' command
