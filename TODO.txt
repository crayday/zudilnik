* implement prelast (penult), preprelast (penpenult) etc.
* sometimes this error occures:
	| > start
	| Traceback (most recent call last):
	| 	File "run.py", line 187, in <module>
	| 		command_string = input('> ')
	| UnicodeDecodeError: 'utf-8' codec can't decode byte 0xd1 in position 4: invalid continuation byte
	need to fix or at least wrap it into try block
* get rid of subprojects, leave only projects.
  - create projects.parent field
  - add field timelog.project_id with corresponding key
  - make a script that will go for each subproject and:
    * create corresponding projects record (with same projects.parent value as in subprojects.parent)
    * fill timelog.project_id field with new ID for all timelog.subproject_id = <OLD_ID>
  - remove field.timelog.subproject_id field
  - remove goals.subproject_id field
  - fix code
* command for counting total duration of some subproject in an interval
  like "2020-02-19" for single day
  or "2020-02-12 2020-02-19" for week
  or "2020-02" for month
  E.g.:
  select sum(duration)/3600.0 from timelog where subproject_id in (select id from subprojects where project_id = (select id from projects where name = "litres")) and started_at between strftime('%s',"2020-08-18 07:15:00+03:00") and strftime('%s',"2020-08-19 07:15:00+03:00");
* ability to archive old subprojects.
  - add field archived_at
  - select old subprojects list this:
    | select distinct sp.id, sp.name
    | from subprojects sp
    |   left join timelog t on t.subproject_id = sp.id
    |     and t.started_at > strftime('%s', 'now') - 3600*24*30*2 -- 2 month
    | where sp.project_id = 1
    |   and t.id is null
    | group by sp.id;
* ability to archive goals like this:
  > archivegoal lt2020
  archivegoal|ag <GOALNAME>
* backup-db: add periodical_run.py to crontab (first run it each minute)
* backup-db: in periodical_run.py write helloworld to log
* backup-db: in periodical_run.py copypaste database to Dropbox
* countable goals
* use cur.commit() in Zudilnik methods instead of parse_command()
* day deadline
* add 'apply when' functionality to 'hoursperday' command
* deny immediate goal reduction
* use cmd module for better command line experience
* grib statistics for litres goals
* get absolute path to database (to be able to run script outside of it's parent directory)
* backup-db: read backup path from config file
