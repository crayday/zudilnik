	need to fix or at least wrap it into try block
* get rid of subprojects, leave only projects.
  - create projects.parent field
  - add field timelog.project_id with corresponding key
  - make a script that will go for each subproject and:
    * create corresponding projects record (with same projects.parent value as in subprojects.parent)
    * fill timelog.project_id field with new ID for all timelog.subproject_id = <OLD_ID>
  - remove field.timelog.subproject_id field
  - remove goals.subproject_id field
  - fix code
* command for counting total duration of some subproject in an interval like
  "2020-02-19" for single day or "2020-02-12 2020-02-19" for week or "2020-02"
  for month
* backup-db: add periodical_run.py to crontab (first run it each minute)
* backup-db: in periodical_run.py write helloworld to log
* backup-db: in periodical_run.py copypaste database to Dropbox
* countable goals
* use cur.commit() in Zudilnik methods instead of parse_command()
* day deadline
* add 'apply when' functionality to 'hoursperday' command
* deny immediate goal reduction
* use cmd module for better command line experience
* grib statistics for litres goals
